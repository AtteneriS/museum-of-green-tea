# The Art of Green Tea

Welcome to my "Art of Green Tea" project. This is a simple, one-page website I built to explore my passion for green tea, from the plant to the peaceful ritual of drinking it.

You can check out the live site here:

### About This Project

This project was inspired by a challenge to copy the page layout of the "Museum of Candy" project website from Colt Steele's ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy. I decided to use that same structure but with my own idea.

I focused on a casual tone and a calming, natural design to match the theme of green tea.

### Tech Stuff

This website was built using a few standard web technologies:

* **HTML:** For the basic page structure.
* **CSS:** For all the custom styling, including the colours and fonts.
* **Bootstrap 5:** The main focus of this project. This popular framework facilitated the creation of a responsive layout.
* **JavaScript:** A little bit of vanilla JS was used to make the navigation bar change colour when you scroll.

### What I Learned

This project was a great way to practice responsive design with Bootstrap to easily change the look and feel of a website's layout.
